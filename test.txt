===Question===
What is machine learning?
=== Answer ===
Machine learning draws upon techniques from a wide range of fields, including com puter science, statistics, and mathematics. For this reason, there is significant varia tion in the terminology used in the discussions of machine learning: Neural networks are typically created with all parameters initialized as small random values from a Gaussian or normal uniform. Once an observation (or more often a set number of observations called a batch) is fed through the network, the outputted value is compared with the observation’s true value using a loss function. This is called forward propagation. Next an algorithm goes “backward” through the network identifying how much each parameter contributed to the error between the predicted
